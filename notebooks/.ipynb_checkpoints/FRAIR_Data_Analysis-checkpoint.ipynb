    "We will follow a methodical approach, starting with the questions we want answered, choose models best suited to answer those questions, and data preparation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Predictive Questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the objective, here are a few specific questions that align with horse racing data and could be valuable for building predictive models:\n",
    "1. ** Performance Prediction Based on Class Changes: How likely is a horse to perform well (win or place) when its trainer and jockey move it up or down a class?\n",
    "> Prioritization: High. Trainer/Jockey combinations are typical inidicators for a horse's performance and a move up can indicate positive sentiment by the team and a step down in class might indicate a lack of confidence, or a feeling that the horse needs to be in a less competive field for a while.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ** Track-Specific Performance: Can certain trainer-jockey combinations predictably improve or diminish a horse’s performance on specific surfaces, such as dirt or turf?\n",
    "> Prioritization: High. Coupled with the trainer/jockey stats on given tracks and surfaces can be a strong indicator.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. ** Impact of Historical Performance Metrics: How do past performance metrics (speed, class rating, distance, and surface) influence a horse’s predicted outcome?\n",
    "> Prioritization: Very High. Ultimately its about the horse and its capabilities.\n",
    " \n",
    "5. Outcome Prediction Based on Race Attributes: How do variables like race type (e.g., stakes, allowance), purse, distance, and surface affect a horse’s probability of winning or placing?\n",
    "> Prioritization: Medium. Possibly when combined with other factors these attributes could be strong indicators. Likely there will be other indicators, like high winning percentage at a give class that would prompt the horse being placed there to compete. \n",
    "\n",
    "6. ** Real-Time Speed and Position Impact: How does a horse’s speed and position at each sectional point relate to its final performance in a race?\n",
    "> Prioritization: Very High. This can yield insights into how a horse’s sectional performance might predict its finishing position, which could enhance live betting models.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.\t** Positional Advantage at Specific Distances: Do horses that maintain a lead or favorable position at specific sectional points (e.g., 600 meters) tend to perform better overall?\n",
    "> Prioritization: High. This is critical for understanding strategic points within a race, especially in conjunction with track and distance data.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.\tConsistency of Stride and Pace: Does a horse’s stride frequency and speed consistency through sectional points correlate with higher performance outcomes?\n",
    "> Prioritization: Medium-High. Examining stride frequency consistency could provide a distinct performance metric for fitness or endurance, complementing speed and class information.\n",
    "\n",
    "8.\tInfluence of Race Pace on Performance: How does the average race pace (derived from the sectional data) influence a horse’s likelihood of winning or placing?\n",
    "> Prioritization: Medium-High. This could help determine the ideal pace for specific horses, which may reveal strategies for early or late acceleration.\n",
    "\n",
    "9.\tImpact of Track Conditions on GPS Performance Metrics: How do track conditions, like “wet” or “firm,” affect horses’ sectional performances and overall outcomes?\n",
    "> Prioritization: Medium. This would help assess if certain horses are more adaptable to specific track conditions, complementing your track-specific analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "10.\tTrainer-Jockey Performance in Real-Time Race Dynamics: Do specific trainer-jockey combinations show consistent strategies in GPS-related metrics, such as speed increases or deceleration at key sectional points?\n",
    "> Prioritization: Medium. Analyzing trainer-jockey strategies could indicate tactical patterns, which can be useful for predicting outcomes based on track and horse attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "11.\tPredicting Optimal Bet Types: Given a horse’s real-time GPS data and historical sectional data, which bet type (e.g., win, place, exacta) has the highest predicted success rate?\n",
    "> Prioritization: Medium. This is valuable for bettors and adds a layer of predictive insight beyond simply the horse’s finishing place.\n",
    "\n",
    "12.\tEarly Race Sectional Points as Predictors: Can early sectional points in a race (e.g., first 400 meters) reliably predict the final outcome?\n",
    "> Prioritization: Medium-Low. While potentially useful, this may vary more depending on distance and horse-specific attributes and is worth exploring as a secondary analysis.\n"

    "Historical data has been obtained from Equibase (EQB) and Total Performance Data (TPD). Equibase has a subsidiary company called TrackMaster where their data actually comes from and they are the authoritative source for all horse racing data in the US, while TPD has proprietary ownership of GPD data that tracks horses via a GPS device in the horse's saddle cloth. \n",
